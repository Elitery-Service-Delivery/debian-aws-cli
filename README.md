# AWS CLI v2 with Debian Docker Container

As an alternative to AWS Official Amazon Linux based [aws-cli docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-cli).

### How it works?
- It based on `debian:bookworm-slim`.
- We extract the [aws-cli v2 Linux x86_64](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip) to the `aws` directory.
